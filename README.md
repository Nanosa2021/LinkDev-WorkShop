# LinkDev-WorkShop
##### LinkDevWorkShop - Developed By Nancy Emad 
##### My Workshop is implemented using Selenium Framework with Java Language 
##### I have followed "Page Object Model " 
##### Extent Report is used for reporting attached some Reports.HTML for the three scenarios 
##### Junit reports are also applied 
##### Log4J is also used for logging 
##### Most of test data are stored in config file
##### Functions are handled dynamically --> Example : adding the second product is always getting the second product from the web application even if the list is changeable every now and then 
##### Each scenario is totally isolated from the other one which means for each one I started from logging tell the end of the scenario (to apply automation standards not to depend on other test)
##### each time I empty the cart in order to have an accurate test
##### if the cart is already empty , there is a performance issue that my code is trying to search for elements in the cart so its taking some time (please wait until three minutes max and the program will continue normally)##### 
##### comments are added for more clarification
##### both Hard and soft assertions are used in my code
##### Maven is applied 
##### POM.XML is applied
